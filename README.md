## Brief Description  
Our short film, podcast with my self, 

The story follows Ali on a train journey, capturing his feelings of anxiety and contemplation as he gazes out the window at the changing landscape. The scene is illuminated by sunlight, accompanied by a soft, reflective melody that enhances his introspective mood. His inner voice questions whether he can find himself during this journey.

As the narrative progresses, Ali experiences moments of reflection. He eventually steps off the train at a new station, where the atmosphere brightens and the music shifts to a more hopeful tone. Embracing the idea that every station represents a new opportunity, Ali recognizes that he is not alone on his journey.
